Aim: Creating a game from scratch and understanding how to manipulate data 

Concepts which I will learn: 
•	Creating a display surface (The canvas that everything will be drawn on, you can only have one at a time) & Rectangles (Wraps around a surface and positions it)
•	Event Loop (Checks events: Keyboard, mouse & controller input, timers) which also includes pressing X to close a game (UI Interactions)
•	While True Loops (On every iteration we get input, update elements and are able to draw a frame)
•	Understanding how to use PyGame in order to create an interactive videogame
•	A fundamental foundation of Python and understanding basic programming code to create an interactive surface. Additionally, understanding debugging, problem solving and how to use Python effectively. 

For this project I will be using Pygame in order to create a video game. The reason I picked PyGame is because it seems to be the most basic and default framework. 
PyGame is easy to learn, however, there is a limited toolset and you don’t get to use things like Unity and other engines. 
The reason I like this is because it will help me get a thorough understanding of how to program, provide me with a hands on experience, and help me understand the basic metrics and foundation of programming in Python. 
By using PyGame by itself I will also get much more practice programming than someone using a game engine, as I understand the intricacy of the code behind it.
